# 1 About Python

Read this chapter if you want to know how Python compares to other languages and its place in the grand scheme of things. Skip ahead—go straight to chapter 3—if you want to start learning Python right away. The information in this chapter is a valid part of this book—but it’s certainly not necessary for programming with Python.

## 1.1 Why should I use Python?

Hundreds of programming languages are available today, from mature languages like C and C++, to newer entries like Ruby, C#, and Lua, to enterprise juggernauts like Java. Choosing a language to learn is difficult. Although no one language is the right choice for every possible situation, I think that Python is a good choice for a large number of programming problems, and it’s also a good choice if you’relearning to program. Hundreds of thousands of programmers around the world use Python, and the number grows every year.

Python continues to attract new users for a variety of reasons. It’s a true cross-plat-form language, running equally well on Windows, Linux/UNIX, and Macintosh plat-forms, as well as others, ranging from supercomputers to cell phones. It can be used to develop small applications and rapid prototypes, but it scales well to permit devel-opment of large programs. It comes with a powerful and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, web programming libraries, and more. And it’s free.

## 1.2 What Python does well

Python is a modern programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s (and named after a famous comedic troupe). Although Python isn’t perfect for every application, its strengths make it a good choice for many situations.

## 1.2.1 Python is easy to use

Programmers familiar with traditional languages will find it easy to learn Python. All of the familiar constructs—loops, conditional statements, arrays, and so forth—are included, but many are easier to use in Python. Here are a few of the reasons why:

- *Types are associated with objects, not variables*. A variable can be assigned a value of any type, and a list can contain objects of many types. This also means that type casting usually isn’t necessary and  that your code isn’t locked into the strait-jacket of predeclared types.

- *Python typically operates at a much higher level of abstraction.* This is partly the result of the way the language is built and partly the result of an extensive standard code library that comes with the Python distribution. A program to download a web page can be written in two or three lines!

- *Syntax rules are very simple.* Although becoming an expert Pythonista takes time and effort, even beginners can absorb enough Python  syntax to write useful code quickly.

Python is well suited for rapid application development. It isn’t unusual for coding an application in Python to take one-fifth the time it would in C or Java and to take as little as one-fifth the number of lines of the equivalent C program. This depends on the particular application, of course; for a numerical algorithm performing mostly integer arithmetic in for loops, there would be much less of a productivity gain. For the average application, the productivity gain can be  significant.
