## 1.2.4 Python is complete — “batteries included”

Another advantage of Python is its “batteries included” philosophy when it comes to libraries. **The idea is that when you install Python, you should have everything you need to do real work without the need to install additional libraries**. This is why the Python standard library comes with modules for handling email, web pages, data-bases, operating-system calls, GUI development, and more.

For example, with Python, you can write a web server to share the files in a directory with just two lines of code:

```python
// python 

import http.server
http.server.test(HandlerClass=http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)

```

There’s no need to install libraries to handle network connections and HTTP; it’s already in Python, **right out of the box**.

## 1.2.5 Python is cross-platform

Python is also an excellent cross-platform language. Python runs on many platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux, UNIX, and so on. **Because it’s interpreted**, *the same code can run on any platform that has a Python interpreter*, and almost all current platforms have one. There are even versions of Python that run on Java (Jython) and .NET (IronPython), giving you even more possible platforms that run Python.

## 1.2.6 Python is free

**Python is also free. Python was originally, and continues to be, developed under the open source model**, and it’s freely available. You can download and install practically any version of Python and use it to develop software for commercial or personal applications, and you don’t need to pay a dime.

Although attitudes are changing, some people are still leery of free software because of concerns about a lack of support, fearing that they lack the clout of paying customers. But Python is used by many established companies as a key part of their business; Google, Rackspace, Industrial Light & Magic, and Honeywell are just a few examples. These companies and many others know Python for what it is: a very stable, reliable, and well-supported product with an active and knowledgeable user community. You’ll get an answer to even the most difficult Python question more quickly on the Python internet newsgroup than you will on most tech-support phone lines, and the Python answer will be free and correct.

Python has a lot going for it: expressiveness, readability, rich included libraries, and cross-platform capabilities. Also, it’s open source. What’s the catch?
